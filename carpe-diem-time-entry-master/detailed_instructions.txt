## PREREQUISITES

1. Install Python 3.x
    - Go to: https://www.python.org/downloads/ and select the most recent release of Python 3.

2. Install Python 2.x
    - Go to: https://www.python.org/downloads/ and select the most recent release of Python 2.7.
    - Add a path to Python 2 by following the directions at: https://geek-university.com/python/add-python-to-the-windows-path/
        - Add the path to Python27 (e.g. `;C:\Python27`) instead of Python34 listed in the guide.
        - WARNING: do not delete existing variables! 
          When following the guide, have a terminal open as a precaution.
          If you accidently delete variables you can recover variables with `echo %PATH%` in the terminal and paste what is printed back into the variable.
          ---------This can only be done if a terminal was ALREADY open---------
    - Go to the location of your Python27 folder and find python.exe
        - Change the name from python.exe to python2.exe
        - Now when you want to execute code with python 2 instead of 3, use the command `python2 file.py`


3. Install pip by following the instructions at: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/
   - On Windows, ensure the install location (e.g. `;C:\Python27\Scripts`) is added to your PATH environment variable.
       * Note: Do this the same way as above: https://geek-university.com/python/add-python-to-the-windows-path/
   
4. Install Tkinter by following the instructions to install Tk at: https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html

5. Run this command from the command line to install dotenv on python2:
    - `python2 -m pip install python-dotenv`

6. Run this command from the command line to install dateutil on python2:
    - `python2 -m pip install python-dateutil`
    
7. Run this command from the command line to install dateutil on python3:
    - `python install python-dateutil`
    
    
    
## SETUP

1. Clone the repository or download and extract the Zip archive.

2. Get your Carpe Diem user details and secret (ONE TIME SETUP).

   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (hint: `copy .env.example .env` on Windows)
   - Replace the placeholders within `.env`, including the `<` `>` characters with the values derived from the steps below. Ensure the last line is blank.
   
   To get the above values, proxy your phone through your computer:
   
   1. Install Carpe Diem Mobile on your phone and ensure you can login and submit entries. Typically available via your corporate intranet site or IT department.
   2. Connect your phone and computer to the same network.
       * Note: Some corporate and public wifi networks block these requests, so using your own wifi network is preferred.
       * Note: This was found to work best on a personal laptop rather than a work laptop.
   3. Download Charles from: https://www.charlesproxy.com/documentation/installation/

   15. Note the full URL in the Overview tab and use it to replace the value for `url` in the `.env` file.
        * Note: If you cannot see your Carpe Diem request information do the following:
           1. With Charles recording, submit a time entry from Carpe Diem Mobile and watch for a request to `cdmobile/TimeKMSV.asp`.
           2. Note the domain in the request.
               * In Charles setup SSL proxying: Proxy > SSL Proxying Settings > SSL Proxying > Add Location: <your-corporate-carpe-diem-domain>:443
           3. Try steps 13-15 again.
   16. On your phone, remove the manual proxy from your network settings .
   17. On your phone, remove the trust setting for the Charles SSL certificate.
   
  
    
## USAGE

Keep track of your time entries using Time_Entry_Template.xlsm.
   - Ensure that the sheet with your entries is titled Time_Entry.
   - Do not change the format of the Excel file.
   - Add in new matter codes to the drop down by adding them to Matter_Codes sheet.
   - Default descriptions for a matter code can be set in the Matter_Codes sheet.
   - If an additional description is to be added to the default, put it in the Additional Description column next to the entry.
   - If additional description fields are the same for one matter code, it will only be used in the summary once.
   - Any differing text in the additional description fields for one matter code will be concatenated together with ". "
   - Add in new jurisdictions to the drop down by adding them to the Jurisdiction sheet.
   - Set your default jurisdiction in cell G2 - This will be used when the "Jurisdiction Change?" field is left empty.
   - Run a summary for all entries you wish to submit. 
   - Review the summary for the entries you wish to submit (in fields V-AB). 
   - Close `Time_Entry_Template.xlsm` before running to_csv.py

Run `python to_csv.py` from a terminal.
   - You will be prompted to enter the range of dates you would submit to Carpe Diem.
   - Next, select the Excel file `Time_Entry_Template.xlsm` where you have your entries stored.
   - A summary of the entries you wish to submit will be displayed along with the number of entries that use the default jurisdiction.
        * You will be asked to confirm that they are correct.
   - Your entries will be saved to a file called `time_to_submit.csv`
   
Run python2 importy.py from a terminal.
   - Select the `time_to_submit.csv` file.
   - You will be asked to confirm that you want to submit x number of entries to Carpe Diem.
   
Log into Carpe Diem and close the entries.
